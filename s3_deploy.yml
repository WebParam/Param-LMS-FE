      # Replace "YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME" with the name of your S3 bucket
      # The "sync" command syncs the "dist" folder to the specified S3 bucket.
      # It uploads new and modified files, and deletes files that are not present in the "dist" folder.

# Replace "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME" with your project name
# This is the name you'll see in the AWS CodeBuild console
# You can also use AWS CodePipeline to automate this process, but it goes beyond the scope of this example.
