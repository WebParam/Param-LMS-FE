This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:



# Preparing deployment

npm run dev
# or

```

2. yarn build

3. aws s3 sync dist/ s3://paramlms (to push to s3 bucket) NB: create IAMUser on aws and create user and all s3 permissions

4. logon to aws, navigate to the bucket paramlms and select all files under object then action and select make public

5. to test visit - http://paramlms.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
